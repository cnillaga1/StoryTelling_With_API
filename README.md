[The Dataset] (https://developers.teleport.org/api/)

# The Research Question: How variable are quality of life and cost of living?

## The Challenge: Tell a compelling story with data collected from at least one of the Teleport APIs linked above.

**Details**:

- Your story can be as simple as covering a handful of cities, or as extensive as country, contintent or global levelâ€¦it is yours to tell!

- Be sure to include visualization(s) and/or summaries.

- You must turn in a single .Rmd file and .html file.

- You may use any R package or tool that you want (with the exception of Shiny, as this does not return a static html).

- You may not use any other language or tool.

- Be innovative in how you explore and visualize the data.

- Your content should be very brief; no more than one page if the .html were to be printed.
